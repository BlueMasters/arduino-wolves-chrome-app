# es6-chrome-app-test

A chrome app to easily configure the Arduino-Wolves arduino through serial.

This app uses webpack and es6 scripts compiled with babel.

During development, simply run:

```
npm run watch
```

and modify/load the chrome-app. The es6 scripts (with `main.js` as the entry point) will be compiled and bundled into `chrome-app/js/bundle.js`.
